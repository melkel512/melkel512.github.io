# Real Time Bus Tracker — Bus Stop Tracker Map Animation
<p></p>
<p>Description of the project:</p>
<p>The goal of this project was to map a bus route along it’s stops. In the initial project, the route ran along a relatively straight path between MIT & Harvard in Cambridge, MA, USA. The bus route animated here, as you will see, runs in a loop-type pattern on a college & multi-hospital campus in Indianapolis, IN, USA. A few key changes made from the initial project include a smaller button, as the initial was quite large; the setTimeout() function was set to 1.5seconds instead of 1 second, in order to make it a bit easier to see the location of the tracker at each stop; and the location of the map was changed, obviously, from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Indianapolis, IN. </p>
<p>How to Run: </p>
<p>When the index.html file is open, click on the “Show Stops Along Crimson Route” button & sit back and watch the tracker move along the IUPUI Jagline’s Crimson route.</p>
<p>Roadmap of future improvements: </p>
<p>This route has a parallel route called the “Gray” route which runs in the opposite direction. A future improvement of this might be to also show that route running in parallel at the same time.</p>
