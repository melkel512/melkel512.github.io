# Eye Movement 
<p>Description of project: </p>
<p>This project started as one eye on the screen that tracked the movement of the mouse across/around the screen. The goal of the project was to create a second eye and make both eyes track the mouse movement in parallel around/across the screen. </p>
<p>How to Run: </p>
<p>This is pretty user-friendly to use because all you have to do is load the file and move your mouse. </p>
<p>Roadmap of future improvements: </p>
<p>While there isnâ€™t really much to this animation, I have thought about things that would make it fun for users (or me). Some of the things I have thought of are: make it eyes on a face that track the mouse, add eyelashes, make the eyes blink, or even making the eyes cross when the mouse is centered on the page. </p>
