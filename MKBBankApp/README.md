# MKBBankApp
## Description/Motivation: 
<br> This "BadBank" app was created as part of the MIT-xPro Full Stack Bootcamp. It was the second portfolio-type assignment done 2/3 of the way through the program (after 20 weeks of instruction). 
<br> It showcases the ability to create a useable, front end application with limited instructions and guidance. <br><br>

## Installation Guidelines: 
<br>Download the files. Open up terminal. Run 'npm install’. Upload to AWS (or similar) server. <br> <br>

## Technology used: 
<br> Front end banking app written with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and React. Utilized Babel, Bootstrap, & React to assist with the formatting and functionality of this page. <br> <br> 
## Features: 
<br> As this page is purely front end, it only saves user data during the single session. When the page is refreshed and/or closed then re-opened, previous data is no longer present. <br> 
The balance will update solely for the sub-page it is on (deposit, withdraw), but does not carry over between the two. 
<br> With the addition of back-end integration, user data would be saved, authenticated, and balance would communicate/update between "encounters".
